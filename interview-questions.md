# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. If you don't know the answer a good tip is to answer a simpler version of the question.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

INSTRUCTOR EXAMPLE: What is a conditional statement?

Your answer:

Researched answer:

1. What is git? What is the difference between git and GitHub?


Your answer:

Git is a software created by a developer to change how code was shared amongst individuals. Now a lot of computers have git installed. The difference between the two: Git is the software itself, while GitHub is a website that allows developers to upload their work and collaborate with others; it’s almost like a social media for git.

Researched answer:

Git is an open-source distributed version control system. Git runs locally and enables multiple developers to work together on non-linear development.

GitHub is an Internet hosting service for software development and version control using git.

2. Which JavaScript operators will return a Boolean value?

 
Your answer:

Ok, let’s see... I know that with a Boolean value, I have two options: True or False. Operators, I am going to say "if" "else" operators.

Researched answer:

The logical OR || (logical disjunction) operator.

<!-- After I researched the question, I realized that I did not fully understand the definition of an operator. I now know that an operator uses symbols and "if/else" is a statement -->

 

3. What is an index? What is the difference between index and value?

 

Your answer: An index is used to count the characters.  The difference between index and value is that index starts counting at zero and counts each item in the array, while value evaluates the entire content and gives an answer.

 

Researched answer: The index property is a read-only property. It contains the position of a regular expression match within a string.

 

4. Compare and contrast arrays and strings. Please include ways in which they are the same and ways in which they are different.

 

Your answer: Arrays hold data in [] brackets. They are a data type, (non-primitive). Strings are characters that are put in between quotation "" marks. They are similar in that they both are data types. They both hold information. They are different because an array is non-primitive, while a string is primitive- you can use it as a building block.

 
Researched answer: Strings are "immutable", meaning, once a strings object is assigned, the value of the object cannot be changed in memory. Arrays are "Mutable", meaning, the fields in an Array can be changed or modified once created. Arrays are efficient for representing data or storing and accessing objects of the same or different data types. Strings refer to a sequence of characters represented as a single data type, while arrays are a sequential collection of elements of similar data types. The length of an array is fixed, while the size of s strig is not.

 

5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

 

Your answer: To properly pair program, both individuals must understand that although there are two computers, you're operating as one and you have a driver and a navigator. Cameras should be on; pseudo coding should be taking place and each individual will contribute equally.

The "driver" will type out code given by the navigator. Both parties will contribute their knowledge of coding, but the driver will execute the code. The navigator will give thorough coding instructions to the driver- step-by-step.

 

Researched answer: Different techniques: The Driver-Navigator style, Unstructured Pair style, Strong Style Pairing, Ping-Pong pairing, Backseat Navigator, Tour Guide and Distributed Pairing. A developmental technique in which two programmers work together at a single workstation. They may switch their role frequently. Sometimes pair programming is known as paring.

 

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

 

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

 

1. Higher Order Functions: Higher Order Functions accepts functions as parameters and returns them. They operate on other functions by taking them as arguments or returning them.

 

2. Jest: A JavaScript framework created by Facebook for their react project. It creates, runs and structures tests.

 

3. Objects: JavaScript objects have properties which define them. An object is a collection of properties.

 

4. Method: Actions that can be performed on objects. It is a property that contains a function definition.

 

5. Classes: A template for JavaScript objects. They can be passes around, assigned, returned and defined inside another expression.
